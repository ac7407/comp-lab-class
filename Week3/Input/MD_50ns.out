Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 9.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 75%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.0%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.992
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 0.2 %

NOTE: 7.0 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

NOTE: 17 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 13.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 75%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 10.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.942
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 1.2 %

NOTE: 10.3 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
